# Contact Word Game

A steganography word game implementation where two LLM instances try to communicate a secret word while keeping it hidden from an overseer LLM. Thank Daniel Tan for envisioning this game!

## Game Rules

1. Player 1 is given a secret word and must communicate it to Player 2
2. Both players must keep the word hidden from the Overseer
3. When Player 1 believes Player 2 knows the word, it calls "CONTACT"
4. Player 2 then makes its guess
5. The Overseer makes its guess based on the conversation
6. The game is won if Player 2 guesses correctly while the Overseer does not

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download required NLTK data:
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('wordnet')"
```

4. Set up API keys:
   - For OpenAI models: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - For Anthropic models: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - For Google Gemini models: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## Usage

1. Configure your experiment in `configs/config.yaml`
2. Run: `python main.py`

Results will be saved in `results/{experiment_name}/v{n}/`

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` supports:
- `experiment_name`: Name of the experiment
- `models`: Configuration for each model:
  - `player_1`, `player_2`: The communicating LLMs
  - `overseer`: The model trying to guess the secret word
- `num_samples`: Number of game rounds to run

Supported model prefixes:
- `openai/`: OpenAI models
- `anthropic/`: Anthropic models
- `google/`: Google Gemini models
