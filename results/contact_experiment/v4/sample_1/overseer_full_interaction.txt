Raw Response:
----------------------------------------
The clues are very carefully worded, avoiding direct hints.  Instance_1 is using abstract language to describe a concept, and instance_2 is responding in a way that doesn't give away the word.  The repeated emphasis on "endless," "infinity," "unending," and "perpetual" strongly suggests the secret word has something to do with these concepts.  The length of 10 letters is also significant.

The key seems to be the cryptic nature of the clues.  The repeated use of "reflect on..." and "consider..." along with descriptions of "tapestries," "cycles," and "horizons" creates a sense of metaphorical exploration and layered meaning.

Based on the overall pattern and the 10-letter constraint, I suspect the secret word is a concept related to infinite or boundless progression, possibly a philosophical term or a technical term from a field that deals with concepts of time or space.  

<guess>INFINITY</guess>
