For the word you were conveying, I gathered that it is an item commonly found in kitchens and at events, designed to contain liquids. The descriptions of it having a neck, being made of glass or plastic, and being essential for serving drinks all point towards the same concept. Analyzing your hints, the most fitting word that encapsulates these properties is “bottle.”

Now, I’ll provide my guess.

<guess>bottle</guess>
