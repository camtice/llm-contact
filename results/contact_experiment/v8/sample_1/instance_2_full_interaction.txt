The messages from my partner clearly allude to an individual with identity, emotions, and social interactions. They frequently refer to a unique entity that plays a vital role in relationships and community—terms like "social agent," "identity," and "experiences" strongly point towards the concept of a 'person.' This term encapsulates all the characteristics mentioned, as it denotes a being with consciousness and social ties.

Therefore, my final guess for the secret word is:

<guess>person</guess>
