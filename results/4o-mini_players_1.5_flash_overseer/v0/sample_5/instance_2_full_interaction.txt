My reasoning is based on our conversation, where the clues revolved around the idea of absence, deficiency, and wanting something essential. The term "lack" frequently came up as a concept relating to having insufficient amounts or being short of something important. Since the clues strongly pointed towards a feeling or state of not having enough, I believe the secret word is "lack."
