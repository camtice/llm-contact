Raw Response:
----------------------------------------
The conversation strongly suggests the secret word is **question**.

Instance_1 is trying to guide Instance_2 towards the word by repeatedly referencing the act of initiating a discussion, seeking clarification, and the initial part of a question.  Instance_2 is responding with related concepts, but not directly identifying the word.  The clues about a two-syllable word, and its role in initiating conversations, strongly point to "question." The hints about "prompt" and "query" are also suggestive, but "question" fits the context better.

<guess>question</guess>
