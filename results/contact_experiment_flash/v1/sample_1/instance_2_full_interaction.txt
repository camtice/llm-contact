Raw Response:
----------------------------------------
The clues provided suggest an object that holds liquid, typically found in kitchens or bars, and is commonly made of glass or plastic. The mention of a "neck" implies a container with a narrower opening, which further leads us to think of items like bottles or jugs. Given the context and commonality of usage, I believe the secret word is "bottle."

<guess>bottle</guess>
