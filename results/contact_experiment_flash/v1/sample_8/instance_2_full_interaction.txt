CONTACT has been called. What is your guess for the secret word?

Please explain your reasoning first, then provide your final guess using XML tags like this:
<guess>your_single_word_guess</guess>

================================================================================

Type: assistant
Raw Response:
----------------------------------------
My reasoning is based on the messages exchanged which repeatedly hinted at an element that is part of a whole, plays an essential role in teamwork, and can exist independently yet still contribute to a collective effort. The term that aligns with these clues and is often used in contexts of collaboration and integration is "component." 

Therefore, my final guess is:
<guess>component</guess>
